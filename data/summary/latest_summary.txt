The wildlife observations listed involve American Bison in the area of Worden, MT, US, with one instance recorded at "沃登, MT, US," which is likely a reference to the same location using Chinese characters. Here is a summary and analysis of the patterns:

1. **Frequency of Observations:**
   - There were numerous sightings in 2024, notably concentrated in the mid to late summer months, with several sightings in August and July.
   - Sightings continued at a less frequent pace from September to December 2024.
   - In 2025, there are observations at the beginning of January and in March, suggesting year-round presence in this area.

2. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - The frequent sightings during July and August 2024 suggest that this time may be significant for American Bison in terms of seasonal behavior or increased activity, possibly due to mating, foraging, or other ecological factors.
   - The consistent presence from late summer into autumn and winter implies that this location might be part of their regular range or migration path.

3. **Location Consistency:**
   - The repeated observations primarily under the same location name, Worden, MT, and the solitary use of "沃登" for March 2025, suggest a consistent habitat for the bison in this vicinity.

Overall, the observations indicate that the American Bison are present year-round in the Worden, MT area, with a peak in sightings during late summer months. This suggests a stable habitat, possibly supporting a resident population or serving as an important part of a migration route. The observations also suggest a need to consider environmental conditions in this region that might support such frequency of activity.
