On June 12, 2025, a variety of wildlife species were observed in and around Yellowstone National Park. The observations included:

1. Plant Species:
   - Elephant's-Head Lousewort observed at Yellowstone National Park, Park County, Wyoming.

2. Bird Species:
   - Black-billed Magpie observed at Yellowstone National Park, Park County, Wyoming.

3. Mammal Species:
   - Wapiti (a subspecies of elk) observed along the Grand Loop Road, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.
   - Holarctic Bears, which could potentially refer to either brown bears or black bears, noted within the United States.
   - American Black Bear observed along the Grand Loop Road, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.
   - American Bison observed at Yellowstone National Park, Teton County, Wyoming.

Interesting patterns include the diversity of species observed within a single day at Yellowstone, encompassing plants, birds, and large mammals. Yellowstone National Park's varied ecosystems support this wide array of species. The presence of both American Black Bears and Holarctic Bears on the same day depicts the park's habitat capability to support a variety of ursine species, though clarification would be needed to understand the specific identity of the Holarctic Bears noted. Additionally, both counties in the park, Park County and Teton County, had notable large mammal presence with elk and bison sightings, highlighting the parkâ€™s expansive wildlife range.
