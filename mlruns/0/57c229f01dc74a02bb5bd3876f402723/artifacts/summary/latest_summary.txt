These wildlife observations document sightings of American Bison primarily in Worden, Montana, with a single observation in 沃登, MT, which appears to be a reference to the same location but using Chinese characters. Here's a summarized analysis of the data:

1. **Location Consistency**: The majority of the observations are from Worden, MT, indicating a strong presence or perhaps a regular movement pattern of American Bison in that area.

2. **Seasonal Patterns**:
   - The observations show a high frequency during the summer months of July and August 2024. This suggests that these months might be particularly favorable for bison sightings in Worden. 
   - There are no observations recorded in the spring prior to March 2025 or in the late winter months post-January 2025, which could suggest lower visibility or different migratory behaviors during this period.

3. **Observation Gaps**: 
   - There's a noticeable gap from early September 2024 until early December 2024, and another from December 2024 into January 2025. These gaps may indicate seasonal migration, changes in behavior such as moving to different areas for food or breeding, or simply fewer reported sightings during those times.
   
4. **Recent Observations**: 
   - The most recent observation was on March 12, 2025, which, combined with the January 2025 sighting, could indicate the beginning of a new season of visibility or activity in Worden for that year.

Overall, these observations provide insights into the movement and presence of American Bison in the Worden, MT area, suggesting a pronounced activity during the warmer months and potential movement or reduced visibility in the fall and winter. Further data would be needed to confirm these patterns as consistent trends.
