This project leverages the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/), which is an open source community for sharing high-quality wildlife sightings.
The Wildlife Analyzer consists of a modular MLOps-style pipeline with the following stages:

- **Fetch:** Fetches relevant observation data from the API based on the parameters specified in the settings
- **Pre-Processing:** Uses Pandas and Python to parse the data into a clean dataframe format, saving it as a CSV
- **Modeling:** Depending on parameter settings, can run various ML and GenAI analyses on the data, including:
  - **KMeans Clustering** using Sci-Kit Learn (in which case there will be a **feature engineering** pipeline stage prior to clustering)
  - **LLM Summary** using gpt-4o through OpenAI API
  - **LLM Analysis** gpt-4o analysis of the data, giving more directed insights and leveraging structured outputs
  - **LLM QA** through a simple chat UI, allowing users to have multi-round conversations about the data
- **Visualization:** Depending on which modeling stages were run, the UI can display various visualizations of the results and metrics
- **Logging/Monitoring:** Following common MLOps practices, various metrics and outputs are logged and saved in a cloud storage system (default a "mock cloud" in a local directory, but AWS S3 logging can be enabled if this repo is run locally)
- **TODO:** While not currently implemented yet, I intend to add periodic monitoring logic to the project, along with automatic parameter updating and pipeline re-deployment based on metrics and performance
  - This will aim to follow the CI/CD principle, continuously testing/monitoring and delivering
  - The current state of the project is meant as a proof of concept, with all of the needed features (logging and cloud storage) to eventually incorporate CI/CD through periodic data fetching, continuous metric monitoring, and managing deployment through tools like GitHub Actions
